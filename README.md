# Typed Notes for Part III Advanced Statistical Mechanics
This my typed notes for the Part III Physics ASM course at University of Cambridge. The notes will be updated weekly according to the schedule of the lectures. If you want to report any typo or mistakes in the notes, please email shw43@cam.ac.uk
## Source codes
All the latex source codes are included in the repo, with all the templates and macros in the preamble/macros/letterfonts tex files. These are very good templates that I found, you are more than welcome to use them and make your own notes.
